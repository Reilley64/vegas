// src/staging/blk_00ba0000_od_o2_nood_variant.cpp - flag-variant unit created 2026-10-24 by flag_moves.py: the bytes and the matched neighbours of these functions
// say /MT /O2 /GS /EHsc /Gy (unit src/staging/blk_00ba0000_od.cpp lists /MT /Od /Oy- /GS /EHsc /Gy). Declarations copied from that unit's skeleton; move the functions to their real
// unit once identified.

// src/staging/blk_00ba0000_od.cpp - STAGING unit created 2026-10-16 by stage_units.py for functions with no attributed unit
// (128 KB address window, od code style). Not a real source path: move functions to their real units once identified.
