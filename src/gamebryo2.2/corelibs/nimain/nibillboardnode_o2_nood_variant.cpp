// src/gamebryo2.2/corelibs/nimain/nibillboardnode_o2_nood_variant.cpp - flag-variant unit created 2026-10-27 by flag_proofs.py: contributor code for these functions matched byte for
// byte only under /MT /O2 /GS /EHsc /Gy (unit src/gamebryo2.2/corelibs/nimain/nibillboardnode.cpp lists /MT /Od /Oy- /GS /EHsc /Gy). Declarations copied from that unit's skeleton; move the functions
// to their real unit once identified.
