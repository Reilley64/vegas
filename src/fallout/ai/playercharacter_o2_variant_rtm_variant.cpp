// src/fallout/ai/playercharacter_o2_variant_rtm_variant.cpp - RTM variant unit created 2026-11-01 by rtm_route.py: community reworks of src/fallout/ai/playercharacter_o2_variant.cpp that match byte for byte only
// with VC9 RTM (cl 15.00.21022.08, the compiler the game was built with). Declarations copied from that unit's skeleton.


// src/fallout/ai/playercharacter_o2_variant.cpp - flag-variant unit created 2026-10-17 by flag_variants.py for src/fallout/ai/playercharacter.cpp functions whose prologue its flags cannot
// produce (frameless code in an /Od unit). Declarations copied from that unit's skeleton; move the functions to their real unit once identified.
